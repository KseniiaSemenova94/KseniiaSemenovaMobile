1. Change settings to run web test on a certain iOS device in mobile cloud. Run test with your changes. Did test pass?
I used UDID instead of deviceName, changed platform to iOS, and test passed without any problem.

3. Run test with your changes. Did test pass?
Yes, if the application was previously installed on the device.

4. Try to use autoLaunch capability with app as before instead of appPackage and appActivity. Does this approach work?
No, in this case I have the error: {"status":13,"value":{"message":"An unknown server-side error occurred while processing the command. Original error: The desired capabilities must include either an app, appPackage or browserName"},"sessionId":null}

8.	Whatâ€™s wrong with our code? How to fix/improve it? Implement your suggestions.
a) I hid non-encrypted access token using Base64, it's not the best solution, but I tried.
b) My code is not cross-platform, I need to add locators for the ios version of the application under test.
