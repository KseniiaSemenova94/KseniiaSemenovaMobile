5. Modify existing tests to run on a real device. What should be changed?
Capabilities “platformName” should be changed to name of real device (in my case it’s FPFDU16B01006411)

6.	Connect a real device to Appium (describe required actions) and run tests.
Are there any difference with run on emulator?
